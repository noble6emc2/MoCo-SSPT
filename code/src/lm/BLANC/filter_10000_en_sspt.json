In these scholars' view, the close contacts between the autochthonous Dacians and the Roman colonists led to the formation of the Romanian people because masses of provincials stayed behind after the Roman Empire abandoned the province in the early 270s. Thereafter the process of Romanization expanded to the neighboring regions due to the free movement of people across the former imperial borders. The spread of Christianity contributed to the process, since Latin was the language of liturgy among the Daco-Romans. The Romans held bridgeheads north of the Lower Danube, keeping Dacia within their sphere of influence uninterruptedly until 376. Proponents of the theory argues that the north-Danubian regions remained the main \"center of Romanization\" after the Slavs started assimilating the Latin-speaking population in the lands south of the river, or forcing them to move even further south in the 7th century. Although for a millennium migratory peoples invaded the territory, a sedentary Christian Romance-speaking population survived, primarily in the densely forested areas, separated from the \"heretic\" or pagan invaders.

The club also continued to improve on the pitch under Wallace's chairmanship. During the 2001–02 season, Stevenage reached the FA Trophy final at Villa Park, but lost 2–0 in the final. Wallace continued to run a tight ship as Stevenage showed signs of gradual improvement. Stevenage became the first side to win a competitive final at the new Wembley Stadium in May 2007; winning 3–2 in the final in front of a competition record crowd of 53,262.

It should therefore be just if the prize would be divided between Johannes Fibiger, the discoverer of the experimental spiroptera carcinoma, and Katsusaburo Yamagiwa, the discoverer of the experimental tar carcinoma.\" But Bergstrand opposed to it, concluding that \"an experimental confirmation of a previously known fact...

In addition to Henschen and Bergstrand, Einar Hammersten was appointed as the third assessor. On Fibiger, Bergstrand was of the same opinion, Hammersten was in favour. Hence the three nominees were recommended for the award. The Nobel Committee decided to give the 1926 prize jointly to Fibiger and Warburg, and the 1927 prize to Wagner-Jauregg.

Valens, marching north after defeating Procopius, surrounded them with a superior force and forced them to surrender.\nIn the spring of 367, Valens crossed the Danube and attacked the Visigoths under Athanaric.

The policy is controversial both within and outside of China because of its manner of implementation and because of concerns about negative economic and social consequences e.g. female infanticide. In oriental cultures, the oldest male child has responsibility of caring for the parents in their old age. Therefore, it is common for oriental families to invest most heavily in the oldest male child, such as providing college, steering them into the most lucrative careers, and so on. To these families, having an oldest male child is paramount, so in a one-child policy, a daughter has no economic benefit, so daughters, especially as a first child, is often targeted for abortion or infanticide.

Metabotropic receptors differ from ionotropic receptors in that they activate other internal cell signaling pathways. Heinemann and his team also discovered the differences between kainate and AMPA receptors, which were previously thought to make up one family of glutamate receptors.

In 1863 he promised to reduce taxes on Chinese junks so as to make them competitive with foreign ships (apparently in bean trade), and wrote to Li Hongzhang suggesting that the Chinese buy and build steamships, which, allowing them to outcompete the foreigners, would remove the need to expel them by force. His proposal was accepted, but 1864 reports by him memorialize China as being surrounded by enemies, and still demonstrates a clear commitment to ordnance.

Wagner. In early March 1939, the New York City Planning Commission endorsed plans for the Battery Bridge, and a bill for the bridge was moved to a vote in the state legislature. The bill was proposed for a vote in the City Council, but this was blocked due to concerns that the bridge's connection to the East River Drive would not be able to accommodate future traffic volumes. The American Institute of Architects asked that the city reconsider the bridge, as it would obstruct the dramatic view of the Manhattan skyline, reduce Battery Park to minuscule size, and destroy what was then the New York Aquarium at Castle Clinton. There was significant opposition from the public, and so the City Council Committee on State Legislation did not approve the plan.

During maceration, phenolics such as the anthocyanins and tannins that contribute to color as well as many flavor components are leached from the skins, seeds and any stems left in contact with the must. In addition to adding color and flavor, these phenolics also serve as antioxidants, protecting the wine from degradation of oxygen exposure. While red wines will often have maceration last several days to even several weeks, the very limited maceration of roses means that these wines will have less stable color, potential flavor components and oxygen protection. This contributes to wines with shorter shelf-life that are meant to be consumed soon after release.\nThe saignee (; French for \"bleed\") method is the practice of removing (\"bleeding off\") some of the juice from the must in order to more deeply concentrate the phenolics, color and flavor the red wine. It has a long history of use in the French wine regions of Bordeaux and Burgundy but wasn't always used for rose production. For some red winemakers, the juice bleed off is simply poured down the drain or used as \"topping wine\" to fill the \"ullage\" (the headspace of barrels and tanks) during storage. Its use in rose production is sometimes considered an afterthought, as a way to increase cash-flow by producing a second wine to a primary red wine that can be released much sooner and available to market. While many wineries have been able to produce critically acclaimed rose using the saignee method, its use has provoked criticism from wine personalities such as Francois Millo, president of the Provence Wine Council (CIVP) who claim that saignee method roses are “not true roses\" because the bleeding process (which is not pressed with the must) is more of an afterthought.", "answers": ["order to"]}

The invaders incurred thirty to fifty thousand dead.\n\nThe Gothic king Ermanaric of a powerful kingdom north of the Danube from the Euxine to the Baltic Sea, had engaged to supply the usurper Procopius with troops for the struggle against Valens. The Gothic army, reportedly numbering 30,000 men, arrived too late to help Procopius, but nevertheless invaded Thrace and began plundering the farms and vineyards of the province. Valens, marching north after defeating Procopius, surrounded them with a superior force and forced them to surrender.\nIn the spring of 367, Valens crossed the Danube and attacked the Visigoths under Athanaric. The Goths fled into the Carpathian Mountains, and the campaign ended with no decisive conclusion. The following spring, a Danube flood prevented Valens from crossing; instead he had his troops construct fortifications. In 369, Valens crossed again, from Noviodunum, and by devastating the country forced Athanaric to attack him. Valens was victorious, and Athanaric received Ermanaric's permission to conclude a truce. Athanaric pleaded for treaty terms and Valens gladly obliged. The treaty seems to have largely cut off relations between Goths and Romans, confining trade and the exchange of troops for tribute.", "answers": ["Noviodunum"]}

Dropped for the second Test, he came back into favour after an innings of 158 in a non-first-class game against a Victoria Country XI where, despite the doubtful calibre of the opposition bowling attack, the other South African front-line batsmen failed. That brought him back into the Test team for the third Test and at last, in his fifth Test match, he made some runs, scoring 47 in the first innings and 9 in the second: the 47 would prove to be his best Test score. The success was fleeting: in the fourth Test, he was out for 20 and 3. The fifth game of the series was Curnow's last-ever Test appearance and one of the most remarkable Tests of all time: a \"timeless\" match, spread out, because of bad weather, over three days but amounting in all to only five hours and 33 minutes of cricket, in which South Africa were dismissed in the first innings for 36 all out and then for 45 all in the second innings. Perversely, Curnow emerged from the match with some credit: his second innings 16, following a first innings 3, was South Africa's highest score of the match and the only double-figure score of the second innings (Jock Cameron had scored 11 in the first innings). Ironmonger took 11 wickets in the match and Clarrie Grimmett, who had taken 33 wickets in the first four games of the series, did not even get to bowl.

After the age of ten years, males lose their territorial nature and replaced by a younger bull, following which they recede to a small and unprotected area. There is another social group, that of the satellite males, which are mature bulls as yet without their own territories, who exploit resources, particularly mating opportunities, even in the presence of the dominant bull. The territorial male may allow a few satellite males into his territory, and they may contribute to its defence. However, gradually they may deprive the actual owner of his territory and seize the area for themselves. In a study in the Lake Nakuru National Park, only 7 percent of the adult males held territories, and only half of the territorial males tolerated one or more satellite males.", "answers": ["group"]}

Horn's key relied heavily on general coloration and elytral pattern for species diagnosis. No other major taxonomic work concerning Heteroceridae was published until 1964, when Pacheco published his dissertation on the systematics, phylogeny and distribution of the family in the New World. Pacheco described 25 additional New World species. He produced worldwide (excluding Africa) identification keys based largely on characters of the male genitalia, leaving it impossible to identify females to species. Pacheco also split the heterocerids into 20 different genera, erecting 17 new generic names, once again relying heavily on characters of the male genitalia. Distribution maps are included in Pacheco's work; however, in his introduction, Pacheco admits that his work did not include enough material to create particularly informative distributions for many New World heterocerids. The only other monograph on the family Heteroceridae was published by Reinhold Charpentier (1965), and this encompassed the species of the Ethiopian region. Charpentier's work included two species level keys, one based on male genitalia, the other on external characteristics.

The proximal-distal axis is formed when the cells of the embryo form the “egg cylinder,” which consists of the extraembryonic tissues, which give rise to structures like the placenta, at the proximal end and the epiblast at the distal end. Many signaling pathways contribute to this reorganization, including BMP, FGF, nodal, and Wnt. Visceral endoderm surrounds the epiblast. The distal visceral endoderm (DVE) migrates to the anterior portion of the embryo, forming the “anterior visceral endoderm” (AVE). This breaks anterior-posterior symmetry and is regulated by nodal signaling.\nThe primitive streak is formed at the beginning of gastrulation and is found at the junction between the extraembryonic tissue and the epiblast on the posterior side of the embryo and the site of ingression. Formation of the primitive streak is reliant upon nodal signaling in the Koller's sickle within the cells contributing to the primitive streak and BMP4 signaling from the extraembryonic tissue. Furthermore, Cer1 and Lefty1 restrict the primitive streak to the appropriate location by antagonizing nodal signaling. The region defined as the primitive streak continues to grow towards the distal tip.", "answers": ["distal end"]}

The \"ups\" operon of \"Sulfolobus\" species is highly induced by UV irradiation. The pili encoded by this operon are employed in promoting cellular aggregation, which is necessary for subsequent DNA exchange between cells, resulting in homologous recombination. A study of the \"Sulfolobales acidocaldarius ups\" operon showed that one of the genes of the operon, \"saci-1497\", encodes an endonuclease III that nicks UV-damaged DNA; and another gene of the operon, \"saci-1500\", encodes a RecQ-like helicase that is able to unwind homologous recombination intermediates such as Holliday junctions. It was proposed that Saci-1497 and Saci-1500 function in an homologous recombination-based DNA repair mechanism that uses transferred DNA as a template. Thus it is thought that the \"ups\" system in combination with homologous recombination provide a DNA damage response which rescues \"Sulfolobales\" from DNA damaging threats.", "answers": ["genes"]}

There are 3 ionotropic glutamate receptors that Heinemann contributed to differentiating: AMPA receptors, NMDA receptors, and kainate receptors. As shown by Heinemann, NMDA receptors differ in that they allow significant amounts of calcium to enter the cell rather than just sodium. Heinemann’s research also illuminated the role of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 in learning and unlearning information using a rodent model. Metabotropic receptors differ from ionotropic receptors in that they activate other internal cell signaling pathways. Heinemann and his team also discovered the differences between kainate and AMPA receptors, which were previously thought to make up one family of glutamate receptors.

However, with Charles Edward's disastrous defeat at the Battle of Culloden in 1746, the Jacobite succession lost both its support and its political importance. James II's other grandson, Henry Benedict Stuart, the last of his legitimate descendants, died in 1807, by which time the Jacobite succession ceased to have supporters in any number.", "answers": ["throne"]}

The Hobart Hebrew Congregation Synagogue was consecrated on 4 July 1845. The building was designed by Hobart Town architect James Thomson, who was a Scottish convict who was pardoned in 1829.\n\nBy the 1840s, there were sufficient numbers and prospered sufficiently to enable the building of synagogues in Hobart Town (1845) and Launceston (1846). The first Jewish minister was appointed in 1846, and religious practices were established. The 1848 census recorded 435 Jews in Tasmania, the highest number of Jews recorded for Tasmania. Numbers declined as some settlers returned to England, and others left for mainland colonies and New Zealand. The Launceston Synagogue closed in 1871. The Hobart Hebrew Congregation continued its communal life. Though there was no minister in the periods 1873–1911 and 1922–1942, Sabbath services were conducted by members. European refugees arriving from 1938 rejuvenated the Jewish community in Tasmania. Ministers were appointed from 1943, but from 1956 members were again required to conduct services.", "answers": ["Launceston"]}

They began by playing covers of American R&B records, and emulated the music of their heroes, The Small Faces. After they supported the latter band on a local bill, Steve Marriott became their mentor, and persuaded Andrew Loog Oldham of Immediate Records to sign them in early 1967. Marriott wanted them to change their name to The Nice, but Oldham insisted on them using the name The Apostolic Intervention, giving the name The Nice to another band instead. Marriott offered the band a song that he and Ronnie Lane had written, \"Tell Me (Have You Ever Seen Me)\", producing their single and playing bass on the record in preference to Bob Argent. The record failed to make the charts, and the song was soon recorded by The Small Faces themselves on their album \"Small Faces\" (issued in the US in a different form as \"There are But Four Small Faces\"). Further attempts at recording The Apostolic Intervention were unsuccessful, and the band split up before the end of 1967.

Dropped for the second Test, he came back into favour after an innings of 158 in a non-first-class game against a Victoria Country XI where, despite the doubtful calibre of the opposition bowling attack, the other South African front-line batsmen failed. That brought him back into the Test team for the third Test and at last, in his fifth Test match, he made some runs, scoring 47 in the first innings and 9 in the second: the 47 would prove to be his best Test score. The success was fleeting: in the fourth Test, he was out for 20 and 3. The fifth game of the series was Curnow's last-ever Test appearance and one of the most remarkable Tests of all time: a \"timeless\" match, spread out, because of bad weather, over three days but amounting in all to only five hours and 33 minutes of cricket, in which South Africa were dismissed in the first innings for 36 all out and then for 45 all in the second innings. Perversely, Curnow emerged from the match with some credit: his second innings 16, following a first innings 3, was South Africa's highest score of the match and the only double-figure score of the second innings (Jock Cameron had scored 11 in the first innings). Ironmonger took 11 wickets in the match and Clarrie Grimmett, who had taken 33 wickets in the first four games of the series, did not even get to bowl. The South African team moved on from Australia to play matches in New Zealand, including two Tests, but Curnow was not picked for any of the games there.", "answers": ["five"]}

Valens, marching north after defeating Procopius, surrounded them with a superior force and forced them to surrender.\nIn the spring of 367, Valens crossed the Danube and attacked the Visigoths under Athanaric. The Goths fled into the Carpathian Mountains, and the campaign ended with no decisive conclusion.

Signs and symptoms of heart failure commonly include shortness of breath, excessive tiredness, and leg swelling. The shortness of breath is usually worse with exercise or while lying down, and may wake the person at night. A limited ability to exercise is also a common feature. Chest pain, including angina, does not typically occur due to heart failure.\nCommon causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, including a previous myocardial infarction (heart attack), high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excess alcohol use, infection, and cardiomyopathy of an unknown cause. These cause heart failure by changing either the structure or the function of the heart. The two types of left ventricular heart failure – heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) – are based on whether the ability of the left ventricle to contract, or to relax, is affected. The severity of the heart failure is graded by the severity of symptoms with exercise. Heart failure is not the same as heart attack (in which part of the heart muscle dies) or cardiac arrest (in which blood flow stops altogether). Other diseases that may have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity, kidney failure, liver problems, anemia, and thyroid disease. Diagnosis is based on symptoms, physical findings, and echocardiography. Blood tests, electrocardiography, and chest radiography may be useful to determine the underlying cause.", "answers": ["congestive heart failure"]}

An orangutan will break off a tree branch that is about a foot long, snap off the twigs and fray one end with its teeth. The orangutan will use the stick to dig in tree holes for termites. They will also use the stick to poke a bee's nest wall, move it around and catch the honey. In addition, orangutans use tools to eat fruit. When the fruit of the \"Neesia\" tree ripens, its hard, ridged husk softens until it falls open. Inside are seeds that the orangutans enjoy eating, but they are surrounded by fiberglass-like hairs that are painful if eaten. Tools are created differently for different uses. Sticks are often made longer or shorter depending on whether they will be used for insects or fruits. If a particular tool proves useful, the orangutan will often save it. Over time, they will collect entire \"toolboxes\". A \"Neesia\"-eating orangutan will select a five-inch stick, strip off its bark, and then carefully collect the hairs with it. Once the fruit is safe, the ape will eat the seeds using the stick or its fingers. Although similar swamps can be found in Borneo, wild Bornean orangutans have not been seen using these types of tools.\nNHNZ filmed the Sumatran orangutan for its show \"Wild Asia: In the Realm of the Red Ape\"; it showed one of them using a simple tool, a twig, to pry food from difficult places.

In addition to Henschen and Bergstrand, Einar Hammersten was appointed as the third assessor. On Fibiger, Bergstrand was of the same opinion, Hammersten was in favour.

At one point, such a surface layer will repel any particles that may still make attempts to deposit. The surface is said to be \"saturated\" or \"blocked\" by the deposited particles. The blocking process can be described by the following equation \nwhere \"B\"(Γ) is the surface blocking function. When there are no deposited particles, Γ = 0 and \"B\"(0) = 1. With increasing number density of deposited particles, the blocking function decreases. The surface saturates at Γ=Γ and \"B\"(Γ) = 0. The simplest blocking function is\nand it is referred to as the Langmuir blocking function, as it is related to the Langmuir isotherm.\nThe blocking process has been studied in detail in terms of the \"random sequential adsorption\" (RSA) model. The simplest RSA model related to deposition of spherical particles considers irreversible adsorption of circular disks. One disk after another is placed randomly at a surface. Once a disk is placed, it sticks at the same spot, and cannot be removed. When an attempt to deposit a disk would result in an overlap with an already deposited disk, this attempt is rejected. Within this model, the surface is initially filled rapidly, but the more one approaches saturation the slower the surface is being filled. Within the RSA model, saturation is referred to as jamming. For circular disks, jamming occurs at a coverage of 0.547. When the depositing particles are polydisperse, much higher surface coverage can be reached, since the small particles will be able to deposit into the holes in between the larger deposited particles. On the other hand, rod like particles may lead to much smaller coverage, since a few misaligned rods may block a large portion of the surface.", "answers": ["already deposited disk"]}

Signs and symptoms of heart failure commonly include shortness of breath, excessive tiredness, and leg swelling. The shortness of breath is usually worse with exercise or while lying down, and may wake the person at night. A limited ability to exercise is also a common feature. Chest pain, including angina, does not typically occur due to heart failure.\nCommon causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, including a previous myocardial infarction (heart attack), high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excess alcohol use, infection, and cardiomyopathy of an unknown cause. These cause heart failure by changing either the structure or the function of the heart. The two types of left ventricular heart failure – heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) – are based on whether the ability of the left ventricle to contract, or to relax, is affected. The severity of the heart failure is graded by the severity of symptoms with exercise. Heart failure is not the same as heart attack (in which part of the heart muscle dies) or cardiac arrest (in which blood flow stops altogether). Other diseases that may have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity, kidney failure, liver problems, anemia, and thyroid disease. Diagnosis is based on symptoms, physical findings, and echocardiography. Blood tests, electrocardiography, and chest radiography may be useful to determine the underlying cause.", "answers": ["congestive heart failure"]}

Signs and symptoms of heart failure commonly include shortness of breath, excessive tiredness, and leg swelling. The shortness of breath is usually worse with exercise or while lying down, and may wake the person at night. A limited ability to exercise is also a common feature. Chest pain, including angina, does not typically occur due to heart failure.\nCommon causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, including a previous myocardial infarction (heart attack), high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excess alcohol use, infection, and cardiomyopathy of an unknown cause. These cause heart failure by changing either the structure or the function of the heart. The two types of left ventricular heart failure – heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) – are based on whether the ability of the left ventricle to contract, or to relax, is affected. The severity of the heart failure is graded by the severity of symptoms with exercise. Heart failure is not the same as heart attack (in which part of the heart muscle dies) or cardiac arrest (in which blood flow stops altogether). Other diseases that may have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity, kidney failure, liver problems, anemia, and thyroid disease. Diagnosis is based on symptoms, physical findings, and echocardiography. Blood tests, electrocardiography, and chest radiography may be useful to determine the underlying cause.", "answers": ["congestive heart failure"]}

In \"Drosophila melanogaster\", tissue expression varies wildly between larval and adult tissue. While expression is extremely widespread in adults, it is not at such a high level as in humans. In larvae, CHID1 is only shown to be expressed in specific tissues, and is up-regulated in very different tissues than in adults. In larval tissues, expression is highest in the salivary gland, but in adults the highest expression by far is in the male accessory gland. Though expression is generally high in some species, it is not necessarily abnormal. \"In situ\" hybridization of gene transcripts in mouse brains shows that CHID1 is expressed relatively normally.

Signs and symptoms of heart failure commonly include shortness of breath, excessive tiredness, and leg swelling. The shortness of breath is usually worse with exercise or while lying down, and may wake the person at night. A limited ability to exercise is also a common feature. Chest pain, including angina, does not typically occur due to heart failure.\nCommon causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, including a previous myocardial infarction (heart attack), high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excess alcohol use, infection, and cardiomyopathy of an unknown cause. These cause heart failure by changing either the structure or the function of the heart. The two types of left ventricular heart failure – heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) – are based on whether the ability of the left ventricle to contract, or to relax, is affected. The severity of the heart failure is graded by the severity of symptoms with exercise. Heart failure is not the same as heart attack (in which part of the heart muscle dies) or cardiac arrest (in which blood flow stops altogether). Other diseases that may have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity, kidney failure, liver problems, anemia, and thyroid disease. Diagnosis is based on symptoms, physical findings, and echocardiography.

During maceration, phenolics such as the anthocyanins and tannins that contribute to color as well as many flavor components are leached from the skins, seeds and any stems left in contact with the must. In addition to adding color and flavor, these phenolics also serve as antioxidants, protecting the wine from degradation of oxygen exposure. While red wines will often have maceration last several days to even several weeks, the very limited maceration of roses means that these wines will have less stable color, potential flavor components and oxygen protection. This contributes to wines with shorter shelf-life that are meant to be consumed soon after release.\nThe saignee (; French for \"bleed\") method is the practice of removing (\"bleeding off\") some of the juice from the must in order to more deeply concentrate the phenolics, color and flavor the red wine. It has a long history of use in the French wine regions of Bordeaux and Burgundy but wasn't always used for rose production. For some red winemakers, the juice bleed off is simply poured down the drain or used as \"topping wine\" to fill the \"ullage\" (the headspace of barrels and tanks) during storage. Its use in rose production is sometimes considered an afterthought, as a way to increase cash-flow by producing a second wine to a primary red wine that can be released much sooner and available to market. While many wineries have been able to produce critically acclaimed rose using the saignee method, its use has provoked criticism from wine personalities such as Francois Millo, president of the Provence Wine Council (CIVP) who claim that saignee method roses are “not true roses\" because the bleeding process (which is not pressed with the must) is more of an afterthought.", "answers": ["order to"]}

Most of the middle rounds were mostly back and forth action with both fighters having success. Whyte was coming forward, countering and began using his jab more while Parker was mostly on the back foot, using movement and landing 2-3 punch combinations. After round six, Whyte began to show fatigue. This did not prevent him from carrying on going forward and trying to land big shots as Parker was wary of Whyte's power. Whyte also started using roughhouse tactics after the first few rounds. This included rabbit punches, head-butting, holding and hitting and pushing Parker over the ropes.

The Council decided against the Arians overwhelmingly (of the estimated 250–318 attendees, all but two agreed to sign the creed and these two, along with Arius, were banished to Illyria).\nAnother result of the Council was an agreement on when to celebrate Easter, the most important feast of the ecclesiastical calendar, decreed in an epistle to the Church of Alexandria in which is simply stated:We also send you the good news of the settlement concerning the holy pasch, namely that in answer to your prayers this question also has been resolved. All the brethren in the East who have hitherto followed the Jewish practice will henceforth observe the custom of the Romans and of yourselves and of all of us who from ancient times have kept Easter together with you.Historically significant as the first effort to attain consensus in the church through an assembly representing all of Christendom, the Council was the first occasion where the technical aspects of Christology were discussed. Through it a precedent was set for subsequent general councils to adopt creeds and canons.

The proximal-distal axis is formed when the cells of the embryo form the “egg cylinder,” which consists of the extraembryonic tissues, which give rise to structures like the placenta, at the proximal end and the epiblast at the distal end. Many signaling pathways contribute to this reorganization, including BMP, FGF, nodal, and Wnt. Visceral endoderm surrounds the epiblast. The distal visceral endoderm (DVE) migrates to the anterior portion of the embryo, forming the “anterior visceral endoderm” (AVE). This breaks anterior-posterior symmetry and is regulated by nodal signaling.\nThe primitive streak is formed at the beginning of gastrulation and is found at the junction between the extraembryonic tissue and the epiblast on the posterior side of the embryo and the site of ingression. Formation of the primitive streak is reliant upon nodal signaling in the Koller's sickle within the cells contributing to the primitive streak and BMP4 signaling from the extraembryonic tissue. Furthermore, Cer1 and Lefty1 restrict the primitive streak to the appropriate location by antagonizing nodal signaling.

At one point, such a surface layer will repel any particles that may still make attempts to deposit. The surface is said to be \"saturated\" or \"blocked\" by the deposited particles. The blocking process can be described by the following equation \nwhere \"B\"(Γ) is the surface blocking function. When there are no deposited particles, Γ = 0 and \"B\"(0) = 1. With increasing number density of deposited particles, the blocking function decreases. The surface saturates at Γ=Γ and \"B\"(Γ) = 0. The simplest blocking function is\nand it is referred to as the Langmuir blocking function, as it is related to the Langmuir isotherm.\nThe blocking process has been studied in detail in terms of the \"random sequential adsorption\" (RSA) model. The simplest RSA model related to deposition of spherical particles considers irreversible adsorption of circular disks. One disk after another is placed randomly at a surface. Once a disk is placed, it sticks at the same spot, and cannot be removed. When an attempt to deposit a disk would result in an overlap with an already deposited disk, this attempt is rejected. Within this model, the surface is initially filled rapidly, but the more one approaches saturation the slower the surface is being filled. Within the RSA model, saturation is referred to as jamming. For circular disks, jamming occurs at a coverage of 0.547. When the depositing particles are polydisperse, much higher surface coverage can be reached, since the small particles will be able to deposit into the holes in between the larger deposited particles.

{"qid": "d07fc253-d8aa-418b-99ef-3a046972fe9e", "question": "Bacteria may thus form species, analogous to Mayr's biological species concept, consisting of asexually reproducing populations that exchange  [BLANK]  by homologous recombination.", "passage": "UV-irradiation increases the frequency of recombination due to genetic exchange in \"S. acidocaldarius\". The \"ups\" operon of \"Sulfolobus\" species is highly induced by UV irradiation. The pili encoded by this operon are employed in promoting cellular aggregation, which is necessary for subsequent DNA exchange between cells, resulting in homologous recombination. A study of the \"Sulfolobales acidocaldarius ups\" operon showed that one of the genes of the operon, \"saci-1497\", encodes an endonuclease III that nicks UV-damaged DNA; and another gene of the operon, \"saci-1500\", encodes a RecQ-like helicase that is able to unwind homologous recombination intermediates such as Holliday junctions. It was proposed that Saci-1497 and Saci-1500 function in an homologous recombination-based DNA repair mechanism that uses transferred DNA as a template. Thus it is thought that the \"ups\" system in combination with homologous recombination provide a DNA damage response which rescues \"Sulfolobales\" from DNA damaging threats.", "answers": ["genes"]}

An orangutan will break off a tree branch that is about a foot long, snap off the twigs and fray one end with its teeth. The orangutan will use the stick to dig in tree holes for termites. They will also use the stick to poke a bee's nest wall, move it around and catch the honey. In addition, orangutans use tools to eat fruit. When the fruit of the \"Neesia\" tree ripens, its hard, ridged husk softens until it falls open. Inside are seeds that the orangutans enjoy eating, but they are surrounded by fiberglass-like hairs that are painful if eaten. Tools are created differently for different uses. Sticks are often made longer or shorter depending on whether they will be used for insects or fruits. If a particular tool proves useful, the orangutan will often save it. Over time, they will collect entire \"toolboxes\". A \"Neesia\"-eating orangutan will select a five-inch stick, strip off its bark, and then carefully collect the hairs with it. Once the fruit is safe, the ape will eat the seeds using the stick or its fingers. Although similar swamps can be found in Borneo, wild Bornean orangutans have not been seen using these types of tools.\nNHNZ filmed the Sumatran orangutan for its show \"Wild Asia: In the Realm of the Red Ape\"; it showed one of them using a simple tool, a twig, to pry food from difficult places.

At one point, such a surface layer will repel any particles that may still make attempts to deposit. The surface is said to be \"saturated\" or \"blocked\" by the deposited particles. The blocking process can be described by the following equation \nwhere \"B\"(Γ) is the surface blocking function. When there are no deposited particles, Γ = 0 and \"B\"(0) = 1. With increasing number density of deposited particles, the blocking function decreases. The surface saturates at Γ=Γ and \"B\"(Γ) = 0. The simplest blocking function is\nand it is referred to as the Langmuir blocking function, as it is related to the Langmuir isotherm.\nThe blocking process has been studied in detail in terms of the \"random sequential adsorption\" (RSA) model. The simplest RSA model related to deposition of spherical particles considers irreversible adsorption of circular disks. One disk after another is placed randomly at a surface. Once a disk is placed, it sticks at the same spot, and cannot be removed. When an attempt to deposit a disk would result in an overlap with an already deposited disk, this attempt is rejected. Within this model, the surface is initially filled rapidly, but the more one approaches saturation the slower the surface is being filled. Within the RSA model, saturation is referred to as jamming. For circular disks, jamming occurs at a coverage of 0.547. When the depositing particles are polydisperse, much higher surface coverage can be reached, since the small particles will be able to deposit into the holes in between the larger deposited particles. On the other hand, rod like particles may lead to much smaller coverage, since a few misaligned rods may block a large portion of the surface.", "answers": ["already deposited disk"]}

St. Alexander of Alexandria and Athanasius took the first position; the popular presbyter Arius, from whom the term Arianism comes, took the second. The Council decided against the Arians overwhelmingly (of the estimated 250–318 attendees, all but two agreed to sign the creed and these two, along with Arius, were banished to Illyria).\nAnother result of the Council was an agreement on when to celebrate Easter, the most important feast of the ecclesiastical calendar, decreed in an epistle to the Church of Alexandria in which is simply stated:We also send you the good news of the settlement concerning the holy pasch, namely that in answer to your prayers this question also has been resolved.

The proximal-distal axis is formed when the cells of the embryo form the “egg cylinder,” which consists of the extraembryonic tissues, which give rise to structures like the placenta, at the proximal end and the epiblast at the distal end. Many signaling pathways contribute to this reorganization, including BMP, FGF, nodal, and Wnt. Visceral endoderm surrounds the epiblast. The distal visceral endoderm (DVE) migrates to the anterior portion of the embryo, forming the “anterior visceral endoderm” (AVE). This breaks anterior-posterior symmetry and is regulated by nodal signaling.\nThe primitive streak is formed at the beginning of gastrulation and is found at the junction between the extraembryonic tissue and the epiblast on the posterior side of the embryo and the site of ingression. Formation of the primitive streak is reliant upon nodal signaling in the Koller's sickle within the cells contributing to the primitive streak and BMP4 signaling from the extraembryonic tissue. Furthermore, Cer1 and Lefty1 restrict the primitive streak to the appropriate location by antagonizing nodal signaling. The region defined as the primitive streak continues to grow towards the distal tip.", "answers": ["distal end"]}

Highly accurate atomic masses are available for virtually all non-radioactive nuclides, but isotopic compositions are both harder to measure to high precision and more subject to variation between samples. For this reason, the relative atomic masses of the 22 mononuclidic elements (which are the same as the isotopic masses for each of the single naturally occurring nuclides of these elements) are known to especially high accuracy. For example, there is an uncertainty of only one part in 38 million for the relative atomic mass of fluorine, a precision which is greater than the current best value for the Avogadro constant (one part in 20 million).\nThe calculation is exemplified for silicon, whose relative atomic mass is especially important in metrology. Silicon exists in nature as a mixture of three isotopes: Si, Si and Si. The atomic masses of these nuclides are known to a precision of one part in 14 billion for Si and about one part in one billion for the others. However the range of natural abundance for the isotopes is such that the standard abundance can only be given to about ±0.001% (see table).\nThe calculation is\nThe estimation of the uncertainty is complicated, especially as the sample distribution is not necessarily symmetrical: the IUPAC standard relative atomic masses are quoted with estimated symmetrical uncertainties, and the value for silicon is 28.0855(3). The relative standard uncertainty in this value is 1 or 10 ppm. To further reflect this natural variability, in 2010, IUPAC made the decision to list the relative atomic masses of 10 elements as an interval rather than a fixed number.", "answers": ["metrology"]}

Botulinum Toxin A injections into the bladder wall can suppress involuntary bladder contractions by blocking nerve signals and may be effective for up to 9 months. The growing knowledge of pathophysiology of overactive bladder fuelled a huge amount of basic and clinical research in this field of pharmacotherapy. A surgical intervention involves the enlargement of the bladder using bowel tissues, although generally used as a last resort.

The Coulee City–Brewster branch of PSH 10 was codified in 1931 as a branch of State Road 10 and re-codified in 1937, during the creation of the primary and secondary state highways; however, the highway was not built between Sims Corner and Bridgeport until the 1950s. The Soap Lake–Coulee City branch of PSH 7 was established in 1937 to serve as an alternate route to SSH 2F, avoiding the Grand Coulee Dam. In 1951, the PSH 10 branch between Bridgeport and Brewster was moved north of the Columbia River via the newly built Columbia River Bridge on the present route of SR 17, as the old route through Bridgeport and over the Brewster Bridge became a new branch that was later signed in 1964 as SR 173.

When Esau goes to the field to hunt for venison to bring home, Rebekah says to her son Jacob, \"Behold, I heard thy father speak to thy brother Esau, saying: 'Bring me venison and prepare a savoury food, that I may eat, and bless thee before the Lord before my death.'\" Rebecca then instructs Jacob in an elaborate deception through which Jacob pretends to be Esau, in order to steal from Esau his blessing from Isaac and his inheritance—which in theory Esau had already agreed to give to Jacob. Jacob follows through with the plan to steal his brother's birthright by bringing the meal his father Isaac requested and pretending to be Esau. Jacob pulled off his disguise by covering himself in hairy lamb skin so that when his blind father went to touch him, his smooth skin did not give him away as an imposter of his hairy brother. Jacob successfully received his father Isaac's blessing. As a result, Jacob becomes the spiritual leader of the family after Isaac's death and the heir of the promises of Abraham ().", "answers": ["Esau"]}

When analyzing the promoter region of CHID1 in humans, this expression is explained by the large number of transcription factor binding sites which are active in a wide range of tissues or are even ubiquitous. In \"Drosophila melanogaster\", tissue expression varies wildly between larval and adult tissue. While expression is extremely widespread in adults, it is not at such a high level as in humans. In larvae, CHID1 is only shown to be expressed in specific tissues, and is up-regulated in very different tissues than in adults. In larval tissues, expression is highest in the salivary gland, but in adults the highest expression by far is in the male accessory gland. Though expression is generally high in some species, it is not necessarily abnormal. \"In situ\" hybridization of gene transcripts in mouse brains shows that CHID1 is expressed relatively normally. The pattern of high and low expression with the brain is very similar to another widespread gene: beta actin. This is one indication that CHID1 may show normal expression patterning in mammals, despite its general upregulation.", "answers": ["human tissues"]}
